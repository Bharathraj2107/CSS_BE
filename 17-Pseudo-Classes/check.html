  p:nth-child(1) {
    color: blue;/*
    Explanation: :nth-child(1) selects the first child of the parent.
Why it doesn't apply: The first child inside the div is <p>, but :nth-child(1) doesn't apply here because the selector is looking for a <p> that is the first child.
Since the first child of the parent (div) is already a <p>, this selector would match. However, in the initial explanation, there might have been a confusion stating that it wouldn’t apply.
In this case, p:nth-child(1) would apply to the first <p> (Paragraph 1) because it’s indeed the first child of the parent.

p:nth-child(2) {
    color: green;/*
    p:nth-child(2)
Explanation: :nth-child(2) selects the second child of the parent, regardless of its type.
Why it doesn't work: The second child in the div is <span>, not a <p>. Since nth-child(2) looks for any element that is the second child and expects it to be a <p>, but finds a <span>, this rule doesn't apply to any <p> elements.
    */
}

p:nth-child(3) {
    color: red;/*
    p:nth-child(3)
Explanation: :nth-child(3) selects the third child of the parent.
Why it works: The third child in the div is a <p> (Paragraph 2). Since the third overall child in the structure is indeed a <p>, p:nth-child(3) applies to Paragraph 2, making it red (according to the CSS).*/
}

p:nth-child(4) {
    color: purple;/*
    p:nth-child(4)
Explanation: :nth-child(4) selects the fourth child of the parent.
Why it doesn't apply: The fourth child in the div is a <p> (Paragraph 3). But :nth-child(4) doesn't work here because the selector is looking for a <p> that is specifically the fourth child of the parent. In this case, the <p> (Paragraph 3) is the fourth child, so p:nth-child(4) should apply. But earlier there was an incorrect statement suggesting otherwise.*/
